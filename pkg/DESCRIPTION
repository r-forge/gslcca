Description: This is a package for Generalized Semi-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (GSLCCA, described in Brain et al, 2011).  GSLCCA estimates the parameters of a given nonlinear model to maximize the correlation with a linear combination of multiple response variables. This method was developed to characterize EEG power spectra under different treatment regimens in research and development projects at Pfizer.
