Description: This is a package for Generalized Semi-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (GSLCCA, described in Brain et al, 2011).  GSLCCA estimates the parameters of a given nonlinear pharmaocometric model to maximize the correlation with a linear combination of the multiple response variables (in this case, the power spectra). This method can be used to characterize brain activity under different treatment regimens in research and development projects at Pfizer.
